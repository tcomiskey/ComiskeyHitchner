Git Intro 2 Activity
==================

A. Form teams
-------------

Form a 2-person team. Try to find someone who uses the same platform as you (e.g., Windows, Linux, etc.). If you can't, that's fine. If you are the odd-person-out, join a team of 2 with permission of your TA.

Make a repo on GitHub.

Complete the exercises below, and fill in your answers in the spaces provided below each question.
Once you have completed all the exercises and filled in this file with your answers, 
add this file to your working directory (which you will create in section G) and push it to your team repo.
This file is the deliverable for this lab, so make sure you do not forget to push it at the end!

1.  List your team members below.

    ```
Tom Comiskey
Erin Hitchner
    ```


D. Getting help
---------------

Run the following commands.

    git help
    git help -ag
    git help init

1.  What does `git help` do?

    ```
Provides a list of the most commonly used git commands and what each one does. Also provides the options that can be used when using the git command.	

    ```

2.  What does `-ag` cause `git help` to do?

    ```
Provides all available git commands without descriptions and provides the common git guides


    ```

G. Basic commands
-----------------

Open the terminal. Navigate to your team’s repository directory.

Create a directory inside of your team repository which will act as your submission directory for this lab.
The directory should be named according to the last names of your team members following the format below.

    <member1LastName>_<member2LastName>_Lab6

Use a plain text editor to create `names.txt` inside the directory you just created.
Put the names of your team in the file. Save and exit.

Run `git status` before and after each of these commands.

    git add names.txt
    git commit –m “Add our names.”
    git log

1.  What kind of information does `git status` report?

    ```
How up to date your machine's version is vs. the repository. What files are staged and what files are being tracked.


    ```

2.  What does `git add names.txt` do?

    ```
Tells git to begin tracking the file names.txt.


    ```

3.  What does `git commit -m "Add our names."` do?

    ```
Stages the changes we made to be pushed as well as writes the commit message "add our names".


    ```

Use a plain text editor to create the following files:

-   `birthdays.txt` - Put your birthdays in this file. (you are not obligated to use real information here)

-   `movies.txt` - Put the last movie each of you watched in alphabetical order.

Run `git status` before and after each of these commands.

    git add .
    git commit		Note:  Commit will open the vim editor; write a multi-line commit
						   message, save and quit (press esc and then type :wq).
    git log

4.  What does `git add .` do? What do you think `.` means?

    ```
Adds all of the files that git does not know about. The . just accounts for any name and any file extension


    ```

5.  What does `git commit` (without -m) do?

    ```
Pulls up the vim editor to write in the commit message


    ```

6.  If you want to write a more detailed commit message (which is
    good practice) what command would you use?

    ```
git commit without the -m because it allows for multiline messages


    ```

7.  What does `git log do`?

    ```
git log tells you who, what, and when the commitments happened and displays the commit messages and id number. Does not show the file names or content of those files


    ```


H. Stage/Cache/Index
--------------------

Do the following:

-   Modify `names.txt` so that names are listed in *Last, First* format,
    one per line.

-   Modify `movies.txt` so they are in reverse alphabetical order
    by title.

-   Create a new file `foods.txt` that contains your favorite foods (one
    for each team member).

Run the following commands:

    git add names.txt
    git status

1.  Below write each file name under the state that its changes are
    currently in. Compose a definition for each state.

    **Staged**

    ```



    ```

    **Unstaged**

    ```



    ```

    **Untracked**

    ```



    ```

1.  If you run `git commit` what changes will be committed (***DON’T DO IT***)?

    ```



    ```

2.  What command do you run to stage changes?

    ```



    ```

3.  What command do you run to unstage changes?

    ```



    ```

Run the following commands:

    git diff
    git diff --cached

1.  What does `git diff` display?

    ```



    ```

2.  What does `git diff --cached` display?

    ```



    ```

3.  Formulate a sequence of commands to unstage changes to `names.txt`,
    and stage the changes to `movies.txt`. Write them here. Execute your commands and
    confirm they worked.

    ```



    ```

4.  Edit `movies.txt`, change any one of the movies, and save it. Then
    run `git status`. What do you observe? Explain what you think is
    going on.

    ```



    ```

5.  Delete `names.txt`. Then run `git status`. What do you observe?
    Explain what you think is going on.

    ```



    ```

6.  Rename `movies.txt` to `last-movies`. Run `git status`. Observe
    and explain.

    ```



    ```

7.  Formulate a sequence of commands to stage all changes including the
    untracked file and commit (with any reasonable message you like).
    Execute them.

    ```



    ```

8.  In git vernacular, `index`, `cache`, and `stage` all refer to the
    same thing. What does it hold?

    ```



    ```

9.  Why have a `stage`? Why not just commit all changes since the last
    commit?

    ```



    ```

I. Undo
-------

Run the following commands:

    git log
    git status
    git reset --soft "HEAD^"
    git log
    git status

1.  What does `git reset --soft ``"HEAD^" `do?

    ```



    ```

Run the following commands:

    git commit –m "Redo."
    git log
    git status
    git reset --hard "HEAD^"
    git log
    git status

1.  What does `git reset --hard ``"HEAD^"`` `do?

    ```



    ```

2.  What is the difference between `--hard` and `--soft`?

    ```



    ```

3.  What do you think `HEAD` means?

    ```


    ```

4.  What do you think `HEAD^` means?

    ```


    ```

5.  On Canvas, put two things: 1) a link to your repo (as a comment on the assignment), and 2) submit this document.

6. Push this document, completed, to your repo.
